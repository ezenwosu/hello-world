Hey, 
   So far so good, Ray. Remember who you are and where you came from. Your family very much love.
   Come on, you can do this. Don't give up! Never give up! You have come too far to allow life to derail you.
   
   Ray, you are so much better than you are showing at the moment. So much better. You are a fighter. Never give up.
